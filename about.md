I’m a technology teacher at Union County Magnet High School, a STEM-focused magnet high school with Union County Vocational Technical Schools. My current courses are Intro to Programming, Advanced Manufacturing, Robotics, and Electric Vehicles.

I also work with the district’s FIRST Robotics Competition Team, Parallel Universe, TSA, and the makerspace.

Beyond the specific classes I teach, I'm interesting in bringing CTE and Maker Education together. I enjoy making things, whether it's a heavily modded [power wheels car](http://powerracingseries.org), code that generates [images for magnetic poetry](http://gersteinj.github.io/text_to_images/), or painting wargaming miniatures.
