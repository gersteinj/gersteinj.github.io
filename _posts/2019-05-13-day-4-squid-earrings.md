Back to something a little simpler - I turned a sketch I made a few weeks ago into a pair of earrings.

The earrings were cut out of 1/8" acrylic. I love the color I used for these - it's Rowmark Color Hues in Flamingo Pink. The edges are so bright it seems to glow. I drew the squid's body with the pen tool, using the grid in my notebook for reference to help me recreate the design. I made the tentacles by drawing individual brush strokes and using the stroke width tool to make them into tentacles instead of simple lines.
