After losing findings I bought for making earrings, I decided it was time for a proper organizer box. Today while sitting on a bus, I figured out a design for it.

The box is designed to form a neat stack. Four magnets hold the lid to the box, and additional magnets can hold boxes to each other. Only one lid is needed for each stack of boxes. The main body of the box is similar to others I've made, but there are a few things here I'm pretty proud of.

1. The design of the box's body is fully parametric. In my (limited so far) testing, I've been able to change the size of the box from a single dialog box, and without having to modify anything but the dividers manually. This was really helpful as I played with dimensions.
2. The magnets actually work really well.
3. I was able to figure out a good way to mount magnets at the top of the box
