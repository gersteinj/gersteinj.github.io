I'm back with a bit of an update and a teaser about some of the posts you'll be seeing soon.

I had to put the 100 day challenge on hiatus to finish up some larger scale projects. I've been hard at work making some cool things, so enjoy the preview and I'll be back after Maker Faire Detroit with more regular posting.
