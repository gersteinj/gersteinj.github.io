With the weather warming up and summer break almost here, I'm looking forward to sitting outside and reading. So today's project is a new bookmark!

![bookmark]({{"/assets/img/hundred-day-challenge/day-19/bookmark-top.jpg"}})

This one's pretty straight forward. I cut it out of very thin acrylic (thin enough to cut easily with scissors) so it doesn't make a huge bump in the book. It clips in place gently - when the book is closed it stays in pretty securely, but when the book is opened it comes out easily.

Materials:

* Rowmark Lucent
* Flower icon from [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/icon/2145239/)
