This design was drawn up by a friend who wanted a better, non-porous bathroom pass. It has the teacher's name and room number at the top, but I've removed them from this photo for privacy reasons.

This one's pretty simple, just raster engraving and cutting up a shape. The design itself isn't mine, so I can't give you the file for it.

Materials:

* 1/8" Rowmark Color Hues in Flamingo Pink
