This design was drawn up by a friend who wanted a better, non-porous bathroom pass. It has the teacher's name and room number at the top, but I've removed them from this photo for privacy reasons.

This one's pretty simple, so I don't have much to say about it. I won't be providing the file for download, since it's not my design to give away.

Materials:

* 1/8" Rowmark Color Hues in Flamingo Pink
