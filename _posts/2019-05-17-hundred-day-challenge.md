A few days ago, I decided to challenge myself to make something every day for 100 days. I'm a few days in, but I want to share my posts here as well. I'll add links to each day here, with more info as well as files for some of the designs.

* Day 1: [Wall Mounted Phone Stand](#)
* Day 2: [WH40k Movement Gauge](#)
* Day 3: [Hanging Lamp](#)
* Day 4: [Squid Earrings](#)
* Day 5: [Map Pendant](#)
* Day 6: [Nail Stamping Plates](#)
* Day 7: [Pegboard Hooks](#)
