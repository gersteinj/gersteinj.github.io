The fume extractor for our laser came with a remote control. It keeps going missing, so for today I made a pegboard holder for it. Not a lot to say about this one. I didn't interlock nearly as much as I usually would, so it's more dependent on glue than usual. I may revisit this one in the future.

Materials:

* Wood: 1/8" Baltic Birch from [Ocooch Hardwoods](https://ocoochhardwoods.com/plywood/baltic-birch-plywood/)
* Glue
