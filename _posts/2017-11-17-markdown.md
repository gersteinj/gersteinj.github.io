Let's start with something easy - Markdown.

Markdown is at the core of a lot of the tools I use. It's simply a way of producing formatted files from plain text files. It's simple to work with - let me show you an example:

#### Where I use Markdown

* My website - posts are written in Markdown and converted to HTML pages using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
* Slide decks - depending what I'm doing, I use either [GitPitch](https://gitpitch.com/) or [Reveal](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/)
* Documentation on [GitHub](https://github.com)
* Notes to myself

#### Reasons I like Markdown

* Requires no special software, although some programs are better than others
* Separates content from appearance
* Source files are easy to read
* Keeps my information from getting locked into a company's ecosystem
* Markdown is part of many useful tools
* [Accessibility](https://tidbits.com/article/13865)

In Markdown, the section above looks like:
```markdown
# INSERT SAMPLE HERE
```

A modern text editor will show the text above with the formatting you can see on this page. Many other tools will do the same. However, anything that can open a text file (pretty much any device) will be able to show you the original file. Because the formatting is designed to look like the output, it's still easy to read, even if it doesn't look as nice.

When processed, the markdown above produces the HTML below. It isn't nearly as convenient to read or write, so I don't write much HTML. These tools are supposed to make my life easier, after all, not harder.

```html
<h1>INSERT SAMPLE HERE</h1>
```


#### How it works

1. Create a file with the .md extension - this is your *source file*
2. Write something in Markdown formatting and save your file
3. You're done. If you view the file somewhere compatible with Markdown, you'll see nicely formatted text. Otherwise, you'll see your original source file - which is still organized text.

## Why Markdown?

#### Separating content from appearance

When I'm writing something, I want to think about what I'm saying and how it's organized, not about how it will look. When I'm dealing with appearance, I don't want to deal with content. I like that when I'm writing in Markdown, I just write and organize my text, and themes are applied to the entire document at once. If I want to change my theme, I can update all my documents in a given project at once. Tools like Google Apps and MS Office have elements of this - font styles are a good example. When I'm working in Google Docs, I use headers and titles to organize my writing, and each level of header has a specific font size and style. No matter what tool I'm using, separating content from appearance makes it easier to edit and maintain my documents.

#### No special software

All you need is a text editor. Any computer will have one - the default for Windows is Notepad and the default for OSX is TextEdit. For Linux, it depends on what version you're using. Android and iOS have text editors available as well. There are [browser-based solutions](https://stackedit.io/) as well. However, if you want to make your life easier, you can get a text editor better than TextEdit or Notepad. Editors like Atom, VS Code, or Sublime Text have features that make things easier and faster. Personally, I tend to use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I have a dark theme to make it easier on my eyes, and I have extensions that let me work faster.

#### Source files are easy to read and write

The source file - the file that gets turned into a formatted document - is mostly plain text, and looks like the eventual output. HTML has some of the same benefits as Markdown, but it's not nearly as easy to read (or write). Most of Markdown formatting comes from shorthand people have used for decades, such as creating bulleted lists by making a list with asterisks or hyphens at the start of each line.

```markdown
Bulleted lists look like this:

* item 1
* item 2
* item 3

Tables look like this:

| index | Name       | Species    |
|-------|------------|------------|
| 1     | Fred       | cat        |
| 2     | Mayim      | dog        |
| 3     | Momo       | cat        |
| 4     | Aaron Purr | cat        |
| 5     | Rumi       | dog        |
```

#### Keeps information from getting locked into a company's ecosystem

Before investing time into a way of doing things, I try to put thought into
