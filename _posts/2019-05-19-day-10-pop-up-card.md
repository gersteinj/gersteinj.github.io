As a kid, I used to love making pop up cards with my mom. She was a huge fan of using technology in crafting, and I wish I could see what she'd do with the tools I have access to now.

For today's project, I wanted to make a housewarming card for friends moving into a new apartment at the end of the month. They have 3 cats and a lot of plants, so I decided to incorporate those into the design. I started with a simple pop up card as a test (I haven't made any challenging pop up cards in years), but wrecked it before I had a chance to take a picture. Once I had a general idea of what I was doing, I sketched out a rough design of what I wanted and set up the artwork. The cats and plant are adapted from [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/), as they would have taken too long for me to draw.

I did an initial rough layout in Illustrator to get a feel for what it would look like, and then I set up my cut and score lines. By barely cutting the fold lines, I was able to score them nicely for sharp folds. I used red lines for cuts and green lines for folds. I still have some improvements to make, such as not putting fold lines at the base of the cats, but overall it worked on only the second try!

I still need to make a backing and finish the rest of the card, but the laser cut portion is ready to go.

Materials:

* Paper: I used scrapbook paper, because I had a ton of it around. I'll get some heavy cardstock to use for this before giving it to my friends.
