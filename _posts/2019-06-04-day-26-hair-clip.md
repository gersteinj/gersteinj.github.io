I like keeping a small ruler on me for estimating measurements, but a lack of pockets makes this difficult. So now I have one that I can clip into my hair or onto my clothes easily. I think the fluorescent pink looks pretty cool too.

This one was done with entirely vector cutting and engraving, no raster passes involved. This kept the cutting time way down and let me finish quickly.
