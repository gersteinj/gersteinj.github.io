My second day is a little (a lot?) more frivolous. I play Warhammer 40,000, and I've started a new Space Marine army. They're purple and teal with cherry blossoms on their shoulder pads. I wanted a movement gauge to go with them, but unsurprisingly it didn't seem to exist. Who ever would have guessed? Fortunately, I've got a laser cutter.

I made this out of Rowmark Lucent. It's a very thin, flexible, translucent acrylic sheet. I wanted something thin and flexible to squeeze it in between models that are near each other and around terrain.

You will be able to download my design [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/downloads/robots-in-heels-movement-gauge.zip) as soon as I get to my old computer.
