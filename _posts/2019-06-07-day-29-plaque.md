Today's piece is part of a project I've been working on with colleagues, honoring the memory of a very loved colleague. Coming up with what to say was hard, but implementation was pretty simple. It's a simple raster engraving, mounted to a base and decorated with a personal item.

**Materials**

* Laserable brass
* Wooden plaque base
* VHB tape (for holding the heart in place)
* Heart (decorative)
