A series of posts in which I'll share some of my favorite tools.

There are great tools out there that are targeted toward educators, but some of my favorites fly under the radar of most teachers because they're aimed at a different demographic. After seeing the reaction to my [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) slides for FabLearn, I decided to put together a series of posts to both share some of my favorite tools and help people try them.

As I write the posts, I'll add them below. Found any tools that seem cool, but too hard to use? Let me know - I love trying new tools, and might be able to help you out too!

Planned Topics:

* Markdown & Text Editors
* Git/GitHub
* gitpitch
* reveal.js
